# Front End (1.5 hrs)

You will have 1.5-ish hours to complete this portion of the assignment. 

### Goals/Outcomes

- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently

### Pre-requisites

- Add your Spotify client ID & secret to `config.js`
  - Note. **Never add this type of config to version control. This would usually come from your build server.**

### Requirements

Please build pages with the following:

1. Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs. Use the API path `new-releases`.
2. Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*. use the API path `featured-playlists`.
3. Fetch and display *Browse Genres*. Use the api path `categories`.
4. (Optional; as time permits) Surprise us with something if you have the time. Your choice. Could even be a bit of writing about the task or description about something you might consider. Or even a recommendation for changes to our take home!

### What's Already Been Done
