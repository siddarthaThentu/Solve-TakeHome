### Your Mission

Please complete the following tasks. If any of the below are ill-defined, take a guess at the best approach to define any missing parts and indicate those assumptions in comments.

#### Task 1 

Please submit the answers in [this file](./db/task1.sql). Please write SQL statements that will:

1. Show each user id with each state name and state code.
2. Return the number of users per state.
3. Return the state with the highest proportion of users.

#### Task 2

Fix the SQL in [this file](./db/task2.sql).
